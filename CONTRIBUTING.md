# Contributing to Stingray

We appreciate every contribution, and we're happy about every new contributor. So please feel invited continue making Stingray best in class!

## Getting started

To get started, you'll need a Mac and likely an AppleTV. While the simulator works for layout, some features aren't supported in the simulator (like PiP). Once you've spent hundreds or thousands of dollars, you'll also need [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). We use the Swift Package Manager for everything, so dependencies should be able to be downloaded quickly. Finally, you'll need to setup a "team" by picking Stingray from the side bar > Stingray from the TARGETS > Signing & Capabilities > and pick your team.
## General

Please try to keep pull requests as focused as possible. A PR should do exactly one thing and not bleed into other, unrelated areas. The smaller a PR, the fewer changes are likely needed, and the quicker it will likely be merged. For larger/more impactful PRs, please reach out to us first to discuss your plans. The best way to do this is through our [Discussions](https://github.com/benjaminRoberts01375/Stingray/discussions/new?category=ideas).

## Finding work

Stingray is very young still, so feel free to tackle open issues.

## Use of generative AI

LLMs often times generate code very difficult to review and maintain, especially since some will change content it has no business changing. Thus we ask you put extra time and care into what the LLM is modifying or adding since it can often be done simpler and less verbose. Failure to do this can cause PRs to be delayed or out right rejected. See the citations section for how to cite your work with LLMs.

## Citations

If your work is heavily inspired by another project, form post, LLM, or other source, please do your best to cite your work with a comment in the code (often a small sentence like "Implementation adapted from ..." will suffice). This helps to ensure that nobody goes uncredited, and we as a community can learn from other people's experiences.
